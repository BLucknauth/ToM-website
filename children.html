					<p>Understanding false beliefs is considered analogous to theory of mind. False beliefs are when another person believes something that is incongruous with reality. </p> 

					<p> In children this is tested by the Sally-Anne task. Children are shown the following: Sally places something into a basket in front of Anne then leaves. While Sally is gone, Anne moves that object into a box. When Sally returns the children are asked where Sally will look for her object. Overwhelmingly, children under the age of four believe Sally will look into the box, suggesting they are not able to decouple their sense of reality from another personâ€™s sense of reality. However, past the age of four, children understand Sally has no reason to believe her marble has moved. Interestingly, autistic children answered the question incorrectly beyond the age of four.</p>
