						<p id="a"> Mirror neurons activate when one sees someone else perform an action. More specifically, mirror neurons demonstrate goal-understanding. </p>

						<p id="b"> In 2008, Umila et al. demonstrated there are neurons in a monkey’s brain that will fire upon understanding of another’s goal. In this experiment, monkeys were taught how to use pliers in order to pick up food. Later, they were shown humans attempting to pick up food with normal and <i>reverse</i> pliers. In both cases, neurons in the F5 area of the brain were activated. However, the action in order to pick up the food with reverse pliers was the complete opposite! This suggests the monkeys were not responding to the other person’s action of using pliers but the ultimate goal, which was picking up food. The human equivalent to the F5 area in monkeys is known as Broca’s area, but mirror neurons can be found in other areas of the brain as well.</p>
