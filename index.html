					<p>We hear it time and time again- “Humans are social creatures”. For much of human history the ability to survive has been intertwined with forming strong social connections. As a result of such extensive social behavior, it evolutionarily follows that specialized mechanisms to foster relationships would develop.</p>

					<p>Theory of mind (or mentalizing) is the ability to understand others’ mental states. There are a multitude of explanations for how exactly we do this, but generally they fall into two categories: theory-theory and simulation theory.</p>

					<p>Theory-Theory states that we have a set of rules and principles that determine behavior. These rules and principles are explicitly stored. Theory-theory is typically domain-specific, meaning it argues there is a specific system in the brain solely responsible for mentalizing. This view of the brain is controversial, as most social neuroscientists agree that there is a low likelihood of complex mental functions being completely localized.</p>

					<p>On the other hand, Simulation Theory is a more domain general theory of mentalizing. Simulation theory states that we understand others’ mental states by simulating their mental states in our own minds. This can be through creating a model of the other person’s situation or the automatic activation of neural circuits corresponding to the other person’s situation. The latter is supported by the discovery of mirror neurons.</p>
